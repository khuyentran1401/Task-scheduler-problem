Creating to-do lists is easy. Creating truly effective to-do lists, and managing those tasks correctly? If you're anything like me - not so much. This repository reframes task management as a classic optimization problem that can be solved mathematically, incorporating the principles behind the Eisenhower Decision Matrix.

The author of this project, [Khuyen Tran](https://github.com/khuyentran1401), also wrote a [great tutorial explaining the logic and math behind this project](https://towardsdatascience.com/maximize-your-productivity-with-python-6110004b45f7), which you should definitely give a read if you're interested in this sort-of thing.
